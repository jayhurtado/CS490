three tier layer architecture. Created a web-based examination system for Python programming questions where a professor and a student can login. For all questions, the student is required to write a function in Python that completes the requirements for that question. Professor adds question to a question bank, creates exam, and can view and/or modify the student's grade before releasing it. Student can take the exam and view his/her grade.
